Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000 to Bobby Rush.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his inauguration, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\r\n\r\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. m\r\n\r\nilitary involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In January 2011, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation\'s debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\r\n\r\nObama was reelected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and state level same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.','{\" Nine months after his inauguration , Obama was named the 2009 ---------- laureate  .\": \" Nobel Peace Prize\", \" Obama served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004 , running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000 to ----------  .\": \" Bobby Rush\", \" Obama was reelected president in November 2012 , defeating ---------- nominee Mitt Romney , and was sworn in for a second term on January 20 , 2013  .\": \" Republican\", \" Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and ---------- , often referred to as `` Obamacare \'\' ; the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ; and the Do n\'t Ask , Do n\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010  .\": \" Affordable Care Act\", \" During his first two years in office , Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the ---------- in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief , Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization , and Job Creation Act of 2010  .\": \" Great Recession\", \" During his second term , Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the ---------- shooting , and has called for greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans , while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and state level same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional  .\": \" Sandy Hook Elementary School\", \" In January 2011 , the Republicans regained control of the ---------- as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats ; and , after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation \'s debt limit , Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012  .\": \" House of Representatives\", \" Born in Honolulu , Hawaii , ---------- is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School , where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review  .\": \" Obama\", \" Obama began his presidential campaign in 2007 and , after a close primary campaign against ---------- in 2008 , he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination  .\": \" Hillary Rodham Clinton\", \" In foreign policy , Obama ordered U.S. military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by the ---------- after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq , continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan , and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba  .\": \" Islamic State\", \" In foreign policy , Obama ended ---------- military involvement in the Iraq War , increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan , signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia , ordered U.S. m ilitary involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi , and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden  .\": \" U.S.\", \" Obama was a community organizer in ---------- before earning his law degree  .\": \" Chicago\", \" Obama then defeated Republican nominee ---------- in the general election , and was inaugurated as president on January 20 , 2009  .\": \" John McCain\", \" ---------- is the 44th and current President of the United States , and the first African American to hold the office  .\": \" Barack Hussein Obama II\", \" Obama worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at ---------- between 1992 and 2004  .\": \" University of Chicago Law School\", \" In 2004 , Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent ---------- in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary , his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July , and his election to the Senate in November  .\": \" Illinois\"}'),('George Washington','Barack Hussein Obama II (US Listeni/b??r??k hu??se?n ??b??m?/; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States, and the first African American to hold the office.
